## 1. What is an EC2 instance type, and how do you choose the right one for your application?

**Answer:**
- EC2 instance types determine the compute, memory, and storage capacity available. Choose an instance type based on your application's requirements. For example:
  - Use `t2.micro` for lightweight web servers.
  - Opt for `c5.large` for compute-intensive tasks like data analysis.
  - Choose `r5.xlarge` for memory-intensive databases.

## 2. What is an EC2 instance family, and when would you use one family over another?

**Answer:**

An **EC2 instance family** groups Amazon EC2 instance types that are optimized for similar use cases. Each family is designed to serve a specific workload type by offering a balance of compute, memory, and storage or by optimizing for one of these parameters. Choosing the right family depends on your application requirements, such as compute power, memory, storage, or networking capabilities.

### Common EC2 Instance Families and Use Cases:
1. **General Purpose (e.g., `T`, `M`, and `A` families):**
   - **Use Case:** Balanced compute, memory, and network resources.
   - **Examples:** Web servers, development environments, small databases.
   - **Instances:** `t2`, `t3`, `m5`, `m6g`.

2. **Compute Optimized (e.g., `C` family):**
   - **Use Case:** High-performance compute workloads that require powerful processors but moderate memory.
   - **Examples:** Batch processing, machine learning inference, high-performance web servers.
   - **Instances:** `c5`, `c6g`.

3. **Memory Optimized (e.g., `R`, `X`, and `Z` families):**
   - **Use Case:** Applications requiring high memory-to-CPU ratios.
   - **Examples:** In-memory databases (Redis, Memcached), real-time big data analytics.
   - **Instances:** `r5`, `r6g`, `x1e`.

4. **Storage Optimized (e.g., `I`, `D`, and `H` families):**
   - **Use Case:** Workloads requiring high read/write throughput and low latency storage.
   - **Examples:** NoSQL databases, data warehousing, Hadoop.
   - **Instances:** `i3`, `d2`, `h1`.

5. **Accelerated Computing (e.g., `P`, `G`, and `F` families):**
   - **Use Case:** Applications requiring specialized hardware like GPUs or FPGAs for acceleration.
   - **Examples:** Machine learning training, graphics rendering, scientific simulations.
   - **Instances:** `p3`, `g4`, `f1`.

### Choosing the Right Family:
- **General Purpose:** When workloads require a balance of compute, memory, and storage, such as web applications or general-purpose servers.
- **Compute Optimized:** When applications demand high computational power with relatively low memory usage, like scientific modeling or batch processing.
- **Memory Optimized:** When workloads require significant memory, such as in-memory caching, real-time analytics, or high-performance databases.
- **Storage Optimized:** When high disk IOPS and throughput are critical, such as for big data analytics or NoSQL databases.
- **Accelerated Computing:** When workloads need specialized hardware for tasks like AI/ML training or real-time video processing.

**Tip:** Always start by analyzing your application requirements, benchmark potential instance types, and leverage AWS's pricing calculator to choose cost-effective options.

## 3. Describe the typical steps involved in launching an EC2 instance.

**Answer:**
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard and click on "Launch Instance."
3. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
4. Select an appropriate instance type based on the application needs.
5. Configure instance details such as network, IAM roles, and auto-scaling options.
6. Add storage (e.g., EBS volumes).
7. Add tags to identify the instance (optional).
8. Configure security groups for inbound/outbound traffic rules.
9. Launch the instance and download the key pair for SSH access.

---

## 4. What is an EC2 user data script, and how can it be used during instance launch?

**Answer:**
- User data scripts are shell commands or scripts that are executed when the instance boots for the first time. They help automate configuration tasks such as software installation or service initialization.

**Example:** Automating Apache installation:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
```

---

## 5. Explain the purpose of EC2 instance metadata and how you can access it from within an instance.

**Answer:**
- EC2 instance metadata provides details about the running instance, such as instance ID, public IP address, and security groups.
- It can be accessed using the following command:
```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

---

## 6. How can you create custom AMIs, and why might you want to do so?

**Answer:**
- Custom AMIs are created by configuring an EC2 instance, stopping it, and selecting "Create Image" in the console. Custom AMIs allow you to save pre-installed software and configurations for repeatable deployments.

---

## 7. What are security groups, and how do they control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances?

**Answer:**
- Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control traffic:
  - **Inbound rules** specify allowed incoming traffic.
  - **Outbound rules** specify allowed outgoing traffic.

**Example Rules:**
- Allow SSH: Port 22, Source `0.0.0.0/0`.
- Allow HTTP: Port 80, Source `0.0.0.0/0`.

---

## 8. Explain the use of Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) and how they differ from security groups.

**Answer:**
- NACLs operate at the subnet level and can explicitly allow or deny traffic.
- Security groups operate at the instance level and only allow traffic (no deny rules).

**Example Use Case:** Use NACLs for broad subnet-level traffic rules and security groups for fine-grained instance-level access control.

---

## 9. How do you enable and configure AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of an EC2-based web application?

**Answer:**
1. Create a Web ACL in AWS WAF.
2. Define rules for filtering (e.g., SQL injection, XSS attacks).
3. Associate the Web ACL with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) or CloudFront distribution in front of your EC2 instances.

---

## 10. What is Auto Scaling, and how can it be used to ensure high availability and scalability of EC2 instances?

**Answer:**
- Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on load:
  - **Scaling Out:** Launches new instances during high traffic.
  - **Scaling In:** Terminates instances during low traffic.
- It ensures cost optimization and application availability.

---

## 11. Explain the purpose of Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and its integration with EC2 instances.

**Answer:**
- ELB distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to improve fault tolerance and application availability.

**Types of ELB:**
1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Routes traffic based on HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** Routes traffic based on high-performance TCP/UDP protocols.
3. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** Legacy layer 4 and layer 7 balancing.

---

## 12. How to resolve boot-related issues like kernel panic in EC2 instances?

**Answer:**
1. Detach the root EBS volume from the instance.
2. Attach it to another healthy instance.
3. Mount and inspect files (e.g., `fstab`) for errors.
4. Correct the issue and reattach the volume to the original instance.
5. Start the instance to verify resolution.

---

## 13. What are the different types of EBS volumes available, and when would you use each type?

**Answer:**
1. **gp2/gp3:** General-purpose SSD for most workloads (e.g., boot volumes, medium-traffic apps).
2. **io1/io2:** High-performance SSD for transactional databases.
3. **st1:** Throughput-optimized HDD for streaming workloads.
4. **sc1:** Cold HDD for infrequently accessed data.

---

## 14. What is an EBS snapshot, and why is it important for data durability and disaster recovery?

**Answer:**
- Snapshots are incremental backups of EBS volumes stored in Amazon S3.
- They allow quick volume recovery and can be used to create new volumes in another region for disaster recovery.

---

## 15. What are some best practices for using Placement Groups in AWS?

**Answer:**
1. Use **Cluster Placement Groups** for low-latency, high-throughput workloads like HPC.
2. Use **Spread Placement Groups** to isolate instances across hardware for fault tolerance.
3. Use **Partition Placement Groups** for large distributed systems to reduce the impact of hardware failures.

---

## 16. How can you monitor the performance and health of EBS volumes, and what AWS services or tools can assist in this process?

**Answer:**
- Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor metrics like IOPS, throughput, and latency.
- Set alarms to detect performance degradation or unusual activity.
